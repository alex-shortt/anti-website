A Notice of Dispute should be sent to: 510 5th\nAvenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10036, or emailed at\nadmin@anti-eshop.com. A-ANTI will provide a Notice of Dispute to you\nvia the email address associated with your A-ANTI User ID. You and\nA-ANTI agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to\ncommencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration\nproceeding until this 45-day post-notice resolution period expires. If\nan agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt\nof the Notice of Dispute, you or A-ANTI may commence an arbitration\nproceeding.\n<br /><br />Arbitration Process and Procedure<br /><br />\nUnless you and A-ANTI agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall\n(1) be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation\nServices, Inc. (\"JAMS\"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration\nRules & Procedures then in effect (the \"JAMS Rules\") and as modified\nby this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing,\nadministration, discovery, and arbitrator fees; (2) be conducted by a\nsingle, neutral arbitrator; and (3) take place in the county where you\nreside. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with\nthe JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute\nClauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the \"Minimum\nStandards\"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.\n<br /><br />We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will\nbe conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or\nrepresentative action. Further, unless both you and A-ANTI expressly\nagree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one\nperson's claims. If this prohibition of class, representative, or\nconsolidated arbitration is found to be unenforceable, then the\nentirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. If, for\nany reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we\neach waive our right to a jury trial. If, for any reason, a claim\nproceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right\nto a jury trial. <br /><br />YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT\nBY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND A-ANTI ARE EACH WAIVING THE\nRIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS\nACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT. <br /><br />The\narbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of\nthe individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary\nto provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n<br /><br />The JAMS Rules are available on its website\nat https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.\nNotwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision\nin the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and\nA-ANTI each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated\nto the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the\narbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and\nenforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.\n<br /><br />Hearing<br /><br />\nIf your claim does not exceed $5,000, you and A-ANTI agree to waive an\noral hearing by the arbitrator and the arbitration will be conducted\nsolely on the basis of documents you and A-ANTI submit to the\narbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines\nthat a hearing is necessary. To the extent an oral hearing is\nrequested by you or A-ANTI, or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, you\nand A-ANTI agree that the hearing will be conducted telephonically or\nvideographically.\n<br /><br />Arbitrator's Decision<br /><br />\nAn arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition\nof each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the\nessential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award.\nThe arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some\nlimited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be\nentered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n<br /><br />Fees<br /><br />\nIt is each parties' responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, case\nmanagement/administrative, and arbitrator fees as set forth in the\nJAMS Rules. If your claim for damages does not exceed $5,000, A-ANTI\nwill pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the\nsubstance of your Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was\nbrought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set\nforth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n<br /><br />Small Claims & Government Actions<br /><br />\nAs an alternative to arbitration, you or A-ANTI may resolve Disputes\nin a small claims court that has jurisdiction over your claim. These\nTerms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing\nyour Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local\ngovernment agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief\nagainst A-ANTI on your behalf.";
